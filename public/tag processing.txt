First COL is one-letter code = what to do with data in that row (delete tag, add new tag, replace tag with other tags, scrape from wikipedia, or download non-wiki image)..

Columns:
A) task (what to do with this row)
B) old tag (optional)
C) new tags (optional)
D) wikipedia page (optional)
E) image link (optional)
F) amazon product link (optional)

There are 5 possible tasks:

1) task=d: delete
Delete old tag

2) task=r: replace
For each thread with old tag (COL B): add ALL the new tags (COL C, comma delimited) & delete old tag. Create new tag(s) if they don't exist. Destroy old tag.

3) task=a: add
Just add new tag (none of these rows have images).

4) task=w: Wikipedia scraping
All of these have a value for wikipedia page (COL D).
Scrape image, description, & license type from wikipedia (like before)
If tag is new, add it.
Use first image from wikipedia page as tag image. (Don't need to store these images, can hot link)

5) task=i: get image (from www link)
Use image link (COL E) to get tag image.
If tag is new, add it.
Also need a description (see below)

----------
Notes:

There may be a few duplicates; it won't matter. Example, if row 333 and row 444 both assign a different image to "sometag," just overwrite the first one.

Scraping: need image, description, & license type. There are 3 slightly different wikipedia pages.
1) https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jarittos-flavors.jpg
2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920s#/media/File:Jazzing_orchestra_1921.png
3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise

License type:
Type will be like "CC-BY-SA-3.0". Only need to worry about 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0 & Public Domain.

Descriptions:
All tags need a description. If data is scraped, description is from wikipedia. Otherwise, use tag name (eg: "Police") as description.

Every description should include: "[shop]" with a link to amazon. If amazon product link exists, use that link; else use generic search link with tag text as search term.

If nothing in COL 6... then use link like:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=TAGTEXT
&linkCode=ur2&tag=anecdotagecom-20

Should strip HTML tags from wikipedia descriptions.

Notes for displaying a tag img on tag page:
- most images (eg from Wikipedia) are rectangles; for image display, use middle section. Add thin black border around circular frame.
- onclick image, go to amazon product link
- beside tag image, put small question mark/tool tip icon; onclick, open image in popup (& show image description)
- if no image exists for tag, use default
- for admin (user 0), please show "replace image" link: opens a form where I can submit image link & description; code should automatically scrape/download info & generate description.



Hey i forgot something important...
Image description should also show AUTHOR

Example
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber#/media/File:The_longest_board_in_the_world_(2002).jpg

Author is "Piotr J"

Our photo description should say:
"The longest plank in the world (2002) is in Poland and measures 36.83 metres (about 120 ft 10 in) long. Wikipedia photo: Piotr J (CC BY-SA 3.0)"

All of our image descriptions should be like:
[Scraped description]. Photo by: [scraped author] ([scraped license type])
EG:
"The longest plank in the world (2002) is in Poland and measures 36.83 metres (about 120 ft 10 in) long. Wikipedia photo: Piotr J (CC BY-SA 3.0)"
Use:
"The longest plank in the world (2002) is in Poland and measures 36.83 metres (about 120 ft 10 in) long. Wikipedia photo (CC BY-SA 3.0)"
Just say "Wikipedia photo" + license type



Description has 4 parts
a) image info
b) author	
c) license
d) [shop] link

Suppose image is for tag = monkeys

a) image info
Try to scrape, else use tag text:
Monkeys

b) author	
Try to scrape, else null

c) license
Try to scrape, else null

d) [shop] link
Try to scrape, else use 
http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=TAGTEXT
&linkCode=ur2&tag=anecdotagecom-20
