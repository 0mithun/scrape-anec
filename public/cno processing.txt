Did you see sheet#2?
CNO list

If thread body contains string in COL A, set CNO using COL B




Many threads still WITHOUT image.
Can we do this:
Use same spreadsheet LIST to get more images from Wikipedia.
For every thread:

If no image:
	{
	For every NAME in list:
		{
		if title contains NAME:
			{
			try scrape 1st image from wikipedia.org/wiki/NAME;
			flag "success" or "error";
			continue;
			}
		}
	For every NAME in list:
		{
		if body contains NAME:
			{
			try scrape 1st image from wikipedia.org/wiki/NAME;
			flag "success" or "error";
			continue;
			}
		}



        Let's also add tag=celebrities if CNO=C



Check thread title first, then body:

If thread title contains any NAME:
1) set CNO (from COL ðŸ˜Ž
2) add tag=celebrities ( if CNO=C )
3) try to grab Wikipedia image (if thread has no image)
4) continue...

Else (title contains no NAME)
So look for a match in body text
If thread body contains any NAME:
(same process 1-4)



Hey... another thing to run locally... insert amazon links for all italicized text (mostly movies, magazines, TV shows)...

In any thread (body) where text is italicized (surrounded by <i></i>, like... <i>Some text here</i>), do this:

1) strip <a href=... > before <i>
(in case link already exists)
2) strip <a href=... > after <i>
(in case link already exists)
3) insert </a> before </i>:
4) insert this after <i>:
